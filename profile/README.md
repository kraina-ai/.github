📍 Geospatial Analysis: Employing state-of-the-art spatial data processing techniques, we discern spatial relationships and distribution patterns, uncovering crucial spatial trends.

🚗 Mobility Insights: Through extensive data mining and modelling, we investigate the dynamics of human and vehicular mobility, optimizing transportation networks and fostering sustainable urban development.

🗺️ Urban Dynamics: Merging urban studies with geospatial analytics, we dissect the drivers behind urban growth, land use changes, and urban sprawl, informing evidence-based urban planning strategies.

🔓 Open source: At Kraina we are actively improving the tooling around the geospatial domain. Our code is fully open-source under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

## Our tools

- [Spatial Representations for AI](https://github.com/kraina-ai/srai) - a Python library standardizing geospatial AI domain,
- [Station Location Recommendation for Bicycle Sharing System](https://pwr-inf.github.io/Transfer-learning-approach-to-bicycle-sharing-systems-station-location-planning-using-OpenStreetMap/) - a tool supporting planners in developing the layout of BSS.
